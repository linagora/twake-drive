# WebDAV Adapter

The Adapter component serves as the interface between the Nephele WebDAV library and Twake Drive's file system. It handles resource location, authorization, and provides methods for creating and retrieving resources.

Key features:
- Implements the `Adapter` interface from Nephele
- Manages URL to file path conversion
- Handles authorization checks
- Creates and retrieves `ResourceService` instances

For implementation details, refer to `Adapter.ts`.
